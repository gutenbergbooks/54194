<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>As there is no need to adopt a strictly chronological
order for the poems included in the present volume, I
have begun with the <em>Orchestra</em> and <em>Nosce Teipsum</em> of
Sir John Davies (1569-1626), who was undoubtedly one
of the most brilliant figures of the Elizabethan Age.
Well-born and gently bred, educated at Winchester and
at New College, Oxford, Davies was exceptionally fortunate
in escaping the pecuniary cares that harassed so many
Elizabethan men of letters. From the Middle Temple he
was called to the bar in 1595 (at the age of twenty-six).
In the previous year <em>Orchestra</em> had been entered in the
Stationers' Register, but the poem was first published in
1596. From the dedicatory sonnet to Richard Martin
we learn that it was written in fifteen days. There are,
however, no signs of haste in the writing, and it may fairly
be claimed that this poem in praise of dancing is a graceful
monument of ingenious fancy. Lucian composed a
valuable and entertaining treatise on dancing, and I suspect
that Περὶ ᾽Ορχήσεως gave Davies the idea of writing
<em>Orchestra</em>.</p>

<p>In the opening stanzas<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> we are presented with a picturesque
description of</p>

<p>lit with a thousand lamps on a festal night when the
suitors had assembled, at the queen's invitation, to hear
the minstrel Phoemius sing the praises of the heroes who
had fought at Troy. With such beauty shone Penelope
that the suitors were abashed at their temerity in having
dared to woo her. But one 'fresh and jolly knight,'
Antinous, so far from being dismayed,</p>

<p>She blushingly declined, and mildly chided him for trying
to persuade her to new-fangled follies. Forthwith he
launched into a rapturous disquisition on the antiquity of
dancing, which began when Love persuaded the jarring
elements&mdash;fire, air, earth, and water&mdash;to cease from conflict
and observe true measure. The sun and moon, the
fixed and wandering stars, the girdling sea and running
streams, all 'yield perfect forms of dancing.' With exuberant
fancy, fetching his illustrations from near and far,
he pursues his theme through many richly-coloured stanzas.
It may be worth while to remark (as his editors have been
silent on the subject) that Davies does not scruple to
borrow freely from Lucian. Take, for instance, stanza
80:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Wherefore was Proteus said himself to change</div>

  <div class="i0">As in his fickle thought he wished to be?</div>
  <div class="i0">But that he danced with such facility,</div>
  <div class="i2">As, like a lion, he could prance with pride,</div>
  <div class="i2">Ply like a plant and like a river glide."</div>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here is another example (Stanza 17):&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Dancing, bright Lady, then began to be</div>
  <div class="i0">When the first seeds whereof the world did spring,</div>

  <div class="i2">And in a dance such measures to observe</div>
  <div class="i2">As all the world their motion should preserve.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With this compare Lucian (as Englished by Jasper Mayne):
'First, then, you plainly seem to me not to know that
dancing is no new invention or of yesterday's or the other
day's growth, or born among our forefathers or their
ancestors. But they who most truly derive dancing, say
it sprung with the first beginning of the universe, and had
a birth equally as ancient as love.' It would be easy to
multiply instances. Of course Davies' borrowings from
Lucian do not for a moment detract from his poem's merit:
indeed they give an added zest.</p>

<p>In the 1596 edition <cite>Orchestra</cite> ends with a compliment to
Queen Elizabeth, and stanzas in praise of Spenser, Daniel,
and others. Davies had evidently intended to write
a sequel; for, when <cite>Orchestra</cite> was republished in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
collective edition of his poems (1622), it was described on
the title-page as 'not finished,' some new stanzas were
added, and it ended abruptly in the middle of a simile.
The poem is quite long enough as we have it in the 1596
edition, and we need not lament that Davies failed to carry
out his intention of continuing it: μηδὲν ἄγαν.</p>

<p>To his youthful days belong the <cite>Epigrams</cite>, which were
bound up with Marlowe's translation of Ovid's <cite>Amores</cite>
(with a Middleburgh imprint): occasionally indecorous,
they are seldom wanting in wit and pleasantry.</p>

<p>In February 1597-8, Davies was disbarred for a breach
of discipline. He quarrelled with Richard Martin (afterwards
Recorder of London)&mdash;to whom he had dedicated
<cite>Orchestra</cite>&mdash;and assaulted him at dinner in the Middle
Temple Hall, breaking a cudgel over his head. Retiring
to Oxford, he engaged in the more peaceful occupation
of composing <cite>Nosce Teipsum</cite>, a poem on the immortality
of the soul, which was published in 1599. It was an
ambitious task that this young disbarred bencher took in
hand, but he acquitted himself ably. Some of his modern
admirers have exceeded all reasonable bounds in their
praise of the poem. Rejecting these extravagant eulogies,
we may claim that Davies, while he was leading the life
of an inns-of-court man of fashion, had remained a steadfast
lover of learning and letters; that he had stored his
mind richly; and that his well-turned quatrains have had
an inspiring influence on later poets. Young, in <cite>Night
Thoughts</cite>, was under special obligation to Davies. Matthew
Arnold had no enthusiasm for Elizabethan writers; but,
unless I am greatly mistaken, he had glanced at <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nosce
Teipsum</i>. In 'A Southern Night' Arnold wrote&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">... 'And see all things from pole to pole,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></div>
  <div class="i2">And glance, and nod, and bustle by,</div>
  <div class="i1">And never once possess our soul</div>
  <div class="i2">Before we die,'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&mdash;a stanza that bears a very suspicious resemblance to
Davies' quatrain&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'We that acquaint ourselves with every zone,</div>
  <div class="i1">And pass both tropics, and behold both poles;</div>
  <div class="i0">When we come home, are to ourselves unknown</div>
  <div class="i1">And unacquainted still with our own souls.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All the arguments for and against the immortality of the
soul were threshed out ages ago, and there is little or
nothing new to say on the subject. A poet's skill lies in
graciously attiring the old commonplaces; in searching out
the right persuasive words and uttering them so melodiously
that dull 'approved verities'&mdash;sparkling with sudden lustre&mdash;are
transmuted into something rich and strange. It is
idle to talk about Davies' 'deep and original thinking.'
Many stanzas can be brushed aside as tiresome and uncouth;
but something will be left. In his handling of the ten-syllabled
quatrain (with alternate rhymes) Davies showed
considerable deftness. The metre has weight and dignity,
but is apt to become stiff and monotonous. Davies certainly
succeeded in securing more freedom and variety than might
have been anticipated. Inspired by his example, Davenant
chose this metre for <cite>Gondibert</cite>; and Davenant was followed
by Dryden, who in the preface to <cite>Annus Mirabilis</cite> says all
that can be said in favour of the quatrain (which was seen
to best advantage in Gray's <cite>Elegy</cite>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Though few may be at the pains to read through <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nosce
Teipsum</i> at a blow, it is a poem that lends itself admirably
to quotation. Towards the end there is a cluster of fine
stanzas('O ignorant poor man,' etc.) that have found their
way into many volumes of selected poetry; and even the
arid tracts are dotted with green oases. Tennyson, with
somewhat wearisome iteration, pleaded through stanza after
stanza of <cite>In Memoriam</cite> that the longing which most men
unquestionably have for immortality must needs be based
on a sure foundation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">'We think we were not made to die,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Thou hast made us, Thou art just.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Davies sums up pithily in a single line:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'If Death do quench us quite, we have great wrong.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A poet greater than Davies, greater than Tennyson, the
august Lucretius, in the noble verses that he pondered
through the still nights (seeking to do justice to the doctrine
of his Master Epicurus), scathingly checks our vaulting
aspirations. If we have enjoyed the banquet of life, why
should we not rise content and pass to our dreamless sleep?
If our life has been wastefully squandered and is become a
weariness to us, why should we hesitate to make an end of
it? 'Aufer abhinc lacrimas, balatro, et compesce querellas!'</p>

<p><cite>Astræa</cite>, a series of acrostic verses on Queen Elizabeth, is
merely a <em>tour de force</em> of courtly ingenuity. Much more
interesting is Davies' group of graceful little poems, <cite>Twelve
Wonders of the World</cite>, published in the second edition
(1608) of Davison's <cite>Poetical Rhapsody</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1603 Davies was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland,
and in 1606 Attorney-General. His letters to Cecil
give a valuable and vivid account of the state of Ireland;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
and his <cite>Discovery of the True Cause why Ireland was never
entirely subdued</cite>, 1612, is a treatise of the first importance.
Davies' political writings wait the attention of a competent
editor, who would undoubtedly find absorbing interest in
his task.</p>

<p>It was the poet's misfortune to marry a crazy rhapsodical
woman (Eleanor Touchet, sister of the notorious Baron
Audley), who annoyed him by putting herself into mourning
and bidding him 'within three years to expect the mortal
blow.' Three days before his death she 'gave him pass to
take his long sleep.' He resented these admonitions, and
testily exclaimed, 'I pray you weep not while I am alive,
and I will give you leave to laugh when I am dead.' On
7th December 1626 he dined with Lord Keeper Coventry,
and on the following morning was found dead of apoplexy.
It was perhaps fortunate that his life had not been prolonged,
for his views of kingly prerogative were high. He
had supported the king's demand for a forced loan, and
(when 'the mortal blow' really came) was about to succeed
Lord Chief Justice Crew, who had been removed from office
for refusing to affirm the legality of such loans.</p>

<p>Not much need be said about <cite>Six Idillia</cite>, 1588, the anonymous
translations (pp. 123-146) from Theocritus. It is a
performance worthy of George Turberville or 'that painful
furtherer of learning' Barnabe Googe. On the verso of the
title page is the Horatian inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i5">'E.D.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Libenter hic et omnis exantlabitur</div>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Collier, misreading this dedication, claimed the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Idillia</i> for
Sir Edward Dyer, and his mistake has been followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
some later bibliographers. But in the first place there is
nothing to show that 'E.D.' was Sir Edward Dyer; and in
the second it is perfectly plain that the translations were
dedicated to 'E.D.,' not written by him. The rhymed
fourteen-syllable lines are somewhat uncouth and do scant
justice to the liquid melody of Theocritus' hexameters; but
though these <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Idillia</i> have no great literary value, the hardy
pioneer is entitled to some credit for breaking new ground.
Only one copy (preserved in the Bodleian Library) of the
original edition is known. Some years ago a small edition,
for private circulation, was issued from the press of Rev.
H.C. Daniel.</p>

<p>Richard Barnfield(1574-1627) had genuine poetical gifts,
but seldom displayed them to advantage. Born in 1574 at
Norbury, near Newport, Shropshire, he was educated at
Brasenose College, Oxford, and is conjectured to have been
a member of Gray's Inn. He seems to have spent most of
his time in the country, leading the life of a country gentleman.
In 1594 he published <cite>The Affectionate Shepheard</cite> (with
a dedication to Lady Penelope Rich), and in 1595 <cite>Cynthia</cite>.
His last work, <cite>The Encomion of Lady Pecunia</cite>, followed in
1598, a second edition (with changes and additions) appearing
in 1605. He died in March 1626-7, leaving a son and a
grand-daughter. In his will he is described as of 'Dorlestone,
in the Countie of Stafford, Esquire.'<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><cite>The Affectionate Shepheard</cite> was inspired by Virgil's Second
Eclogue. Though the choice of subject was not happy, it
must be allowed that in describing country contentment
and the pastimes of silly shepherds Barnfield shows un-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>laboured
fluency and grace, with playful touches of quaint
extravagance. The passage beginning 'And when th'art
wearie of thy keeping Sheepe'(pp. 159, 160) and ending
'Like Lillyes in a bed of roses shed' is a pleasant piece of
poetical embroidery. Barnfield doubtless adopted the six-line
stanza in imitation of <cite>Venus and Adonis</cite>, 1593(which
had in turn been modelled on Lodge's <cite>Glaucus and Scylla</cite>,
1589). It has been recently pointed out&mdash;by Mr. Charles
Crawford in <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>&mdash;that some passages in <cite>The
Affectionate Shepheard</cite> were closely imitated from Marlowe
and Nashe's <cite>Dido</cite> (published in 1594), and that one line has
been taken straight out of Marlowe's <cite>Edward II.</cite> Appended
to <cite>The Affectionate Shepheard</cite> are <cite>The Complainte of Chastitie</cite>,
in imitation of Michael Drayton, and <cite>Hellens Rape</cite>&mdash;a copy
of 'English Hexameters' so atrociously bad that one
wonders whether it was written to bring contempt on the
metre which Gabriel Harvey and others were vainly striving
to popularise.</p>

<p>To <cite>Cynthia</cite> is prefixed a copy of high-flying commendatory
verses, from which very little sense can be extracted,
by 'T.T.,' possibly Thomas Thorpe, the publisher of
Shakespeare's Sonnets. In the address to 'The Curteous
Gentlemen Readers' Barnfield claims indulgence for <cite>Cynthia</cite>
on the ground that it was the first 'imitation of the verse of
that excellent Poet, Maister <em>Spencer</em>, in his <cite>Fayrie Queene</cite>.'
The poem is a compliment to Queen Elizabeth, who is
adjudged by Jove to have merited the golden apple wrongly
given by Paris to Venus. When Barnfield mentioned that he
borrowed the metre of <cite>Cynthia</cite> from Spenser, he forgot to
add that the matter was drawn from Peele's <cite>Arraignment of
Paris</cite>. To <cite>Cynthia</cite> succeed twenty sonnets extolling, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
fashion of the age, the beauty and virtues of an imaginary
youth, Ganymede. In the last sonnet Barnfield introduces
compliments to Spenser (Colin) and Drayton (Rowland):&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Ah had great <em>Colin</em>, chiefe of sheepheards all,</div>
  <div class="i1">Or gentle <em>Rowland</em>, my professed friend,</div>
  <div class="i1">Had they thy beautie, or my pennance pend,</div>
  <div class="i0">Greater had beene thy fame, and lesse my fall:</div>
  <div class="i1">But since that euerie one cannot be wittie,</div>
  <div class="i1">Pardon I craue of them, and of thee pitty.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The 'Ode' that follows the sonnets runs trippingly away in
easy trochaics; but <cite>Cassandra</cite> is laboured and languid.</p>

<p><cite>The Encomion of Lady Pecunia</cite> has an 'Address to the
Gentlemen Readers,' in which Barnfield states that he had
been at much pains to find an unhackneyed subject for his
pen. After long consideration he had determined to write
the praises of money, a theme both new (for none had
ventured upon it before) and pleasing (for money is always
in esteem). It was in pursuit of money that Hawkins and
Drake had lost their lives. Barnfield wrote a fine epitaph
on Hawkins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'The<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Waters were his Winding sheete, the Sea was made his Toome;</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet for his fame the Ocean Sea was not sufficient roome.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His lines on Drake are not quite so happy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'England<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> his hart; his Corps the Waters have;</div>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span></p>

<p>The <cite>Encomion</cite> is smoothly written, and is not without
humour. A country gentleman in easy circumstances,
Barnfield could dally playfully with a subject that had
for him no terrors. His example probably led 'T. A.'
(Thomas Acheley?) to write <cite>The Massacre of Money</cite>, 1602.
<cite>The Complaint of Poetrie for the Death of Liberalitie</cite> seems
to be an imitation of Spenser's <cite>Teares of the Muses</cite>. More
interesting are the <cite>Poems: in divers humors</cite> at the end of
the booklet, for among them are the sonnet 'If Musique
and sweet Poetrie agree,' and the 'Ode' beginning 'As it
fell upon a day,' which were long ascribed erroneously to
Shakespeare. In the poem entitled 'A Remembrance of
some English Poets' Barnfield praises Spenser, Daniel,
Drayton, and Shakespeare. For Sir Philip Sidney he had
a deep admiration, but his 'Epitaph' was a poor tribute.
The verse with which the tract ends,'A Comparison of the
Life of Man,' is distinctly impressive:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Mans life is well compared to a feast,</div>
  <div class="i0">Furnisht with choice of all Varietie:</div>
  <div class="i0">To it comes Tyme; and as a bidden guest</div>
  <div class="i0">Hee sets him downe, in Pompe and Majestie;</div>
  <div class="i0">The three-folde Age of Man the Waiters bee:</div>
  <div class="i1">Then with an earthen voyder (made of clay)</div>
  <div class="i1">Comes Death, and takes the table clean away.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We now reach a group of elegies (pp. 271-318) by various
hands on Sir Philip Sidney, printed as an Appendix to
Spenser's <cite>Colin Clouts Come Home Againe</cite>, 1595, with a
dedication to Sidney's widow, who by her second marriage
had become Countess of Essex. There was no man more
generally beloved than Sidney, and none whose loss was
more sincerely deplored. Numberless were the tributes
paid in verse and prose to his memory. The present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
collection embraces 'Astrophel,' by Spenser; the 'Dolefull
Lay of Clorinda,' by Sidney's sister, the Countess of Pembroke;
'The Mourning Muse of Thestylis' and 'A Pastorall
Æglogue,' both by Lodowick Bryskett; 'An Elegie, or
Friends Passion, for his Astrophel,' by Matthew Roydon;
'An Epitaph,' probably by Sir Walter Ralegh; and
'Another of the same' (<em>i.e.</em> on the same subject), which
Malone was inclined to attribute to Sir Edward Dyer,
while Charles Lamb ascribed it on internal evidence to
Fulke Greville. Although <cite>Colin Clouts Come Home Againe</cite>
was first published in 1595, the dedicatory epistle to Sir
Walter Ralegh is dated from Kilcolman, 27th December
1591. All the elegies were doubtless written soon after
Sidney's death. Lodowick Bryskett's two poems had been
entered in the Stationers' Register on 22nd August 1587,
but are not known to have been separately published.
Matthew Roydon's elegy had appeared in the <cite>Ph&oelig;nix Nest</cite>,
1593, where also are found the 'Epitaph' and 'Another of
the Same. Excellently written by a most woorthy gentleman.'</p>

<p>In <cite>The Ruines of Time</cite> (1591) there are some fine stanzas
to Sidney's memory; but if the literary public expected an
elaborate elegy from Spenser, 'Astrophel' must have disappointed
their hopes. When we recall Moschus' lament
over Bion, or Ovid's tribute to Tibullus, or <cite>Lycidas</cite>, or
<cite>Adonais</cite>, Spenser's elegy on Sidney seems thin and
colourless. Scores of poets who had not a tithe of
Spenser's genius have left elegies that far transcend
'Astrophel.' Lady Pembroke's sisterly tribute of affection
will be read with respect; but however much we may
commend the pious intentions of the naturalised Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
Ludowick Bryskett, it is impossible to find a word of praise
for such 'rude rhymes' as</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Come forth, ye Nymphes, come forth, forsake your watry boures!</div>
  <div class="i0">Forsake your mossy caves and help me to lament;</div>
  <div class="i0">Help me to tune my dolefull notes to gurgling sound</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Liffies tumbling streames; come, let salt teares of ours</div>
  <div class="i0">Mix with his waters fresh,' etc.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Matthew Roydon's elegy is too diffuse, but has some most
happy and memorable stanzas. As we gaze at Isaac
Oliver's beautiful miniature of Sidney, in the Windsor
Palace collection, those oft-quoted lines of Roydon inevitably
leap to the lips:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'A sweet attractive kind of grace,</div>

<p>The 'Epitaph' beginning, 'To praise thy life, or waile thy
worthie death' appears to have been written by Sir Walter
Ralegh. Sir John Harington, in the notes appended to the
sixteenth book of his translation of <cite>Orlando Furioso</cite> (1591),
refers to 'our English Petrarke, Sir Philip Sidney, or (as
Sir Walter Rawleigh in his Epitaph worthily calleth him)
the Scipio and the Petrarke of our time' (see the last stanza
of the poem). Harington had evidently seen the 'Epitaph'
in <span class="smcap">ms</span>.; and there is not the slightest reason for questioning
the accuracy of his ascription, for he was well acquainted
with the poets of the time, and curious information may be
gathered from his Notes. I find Ralegh's elegy somewhat
obscure; pregnant, but harshly worded. Nor can I profess
any great admiration for 'Another of the same,' where the
vehemence of the writer's grief choked his utterance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the first edition of <cite>Alcilia: Philoparthen's Loving
Folly</cite>, 1595 (pp. 319-362), only one copy is known, preserved
in the public library at Hamburgh. On the last page are
subscribed the author's initials 'J.C.', which have been
altered in ink to 'J.G.' in the Hamburgh copy. The poem
was reprinted in London in 1613, 1619, and 1628, being
accompanied by Marston's <cite>Pygmalion's Image</cite> and Samuel
Page's <cite>Amos and Laura</cite>. Who 'J.C.' may have been is
unknown; for the wild conjecture that he was John Chalkhill,
author of <cite>Thealma and Clearchus</cite> and friend of Izaak
Walton, is chronologically untenable. For the space of two
years the unknown poet had pressed his attentions upon
the lady whom he called Alcilia. She finally rejected his
addresses, and young 'J.C.' was not sorry to escape from
bondage. Hardly a trace of genuine passion can be found
in <cite>Alcilia</cite>, which is merely (as the author freely admits) a
collection of odds and ends written 'at divers times and
upon divers occasions.' It is somewhat surprising that
there was a demand for new editions. 'J.C.' wrote with
elegance and facility, but the note of originality is wanting.
Had the poem appeared a few years earlier, it would have
been entitled to more consideration; but the achievements
of Greene, Lodge, and others had made it possible in the
closing years of the sixteenth century for any young writer
of respectable talents to compose such verse as we find in
<cite>Alcilia</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Daiphantus</cite>, or <cite>The Passions of Love</cite>, 1604 (pp. 363-404),
is described on the title-page as 'By An. Sc. Gentleman,'
assumed to stand for Antony Scoloker. In the days of
Henry VIII there was an Antony Scoloker, a printer and
translator, with whom 'An. Sc.' was doubtless connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
In the humorous prose address there is an interesting
reference to Shakespeare:&mdash;'It should be like the never-too-well-read
<cite>Arcadia</cite> where the Prose and Verse, Matter and
Words, are like his Mistress eyes, one still excelling
another and without corrival; or to come home to the
Vulgar's element, like friendly Shake-speare's <cite>Tragedies</cite>,
where the Comedian rides when the Tragedian stands on
tiptoe. Faith it should please all like Prince <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>.
But, in sadness, then it were to be feared he would run
mad. In sooth I will not be moonsick to please, nor out of
my wits though I displease all. What? Poet, are you in
passion or out of Love? This is as strange as true.' In
the poem itself there is another reference to 'mad Hamlet,'
though Scoloker there seems to be glancing at the older
play on the subject of Hamlet. For the reader's guidance
an 'Argument' is obligingly prefixed, but it is to be feared
that even with the help of this Argument he will not find
the poem very intelligible or of engrossing interest. <cite>Daiphantus</cite>,
of which only one copy (in the Douce Collection)
is known, was perhaps intended merely for circulation
among the author's friends, who may have been able to
read between the lines. Appended is the fine poem, 'The
Passionate Man's Pilgrimage,' beginning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Give me my Scalop Shell of quiet,</div>
  <div class="i0">My Staff of faith to walk upon,</div>
  <div class="i0">My Scrip of joy, immortal diet,</div>
  <div class="i0">My Bottle of salvation,</div>
  <div class="i0">My Gown of glory, hope's true gage,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thus I'll take my Pilgrimage,' etc.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Possibly the publisher tacked on these verses without
Scoloker's knowledge. It is quite certain that they were
not written by the author of <cite>Daiphantus</cite>, and there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
good reasons for assigning them to Sir Walter Ralegh
(<em>see</em> Hannah's edition of Ralegh's <cite>Poems</cite>, 1885).</p>

<p>The 'Odes' of Michael Drayton (pp. 405-441), drawn from
<cite>Poems Lyrick and Pastorall</cite> (1606?), and the later collection
of 1619, contain some of his best writing. There is no need
to praise the glorious 'Ballad of Agincourt,' but it may be
noted that Drayton spent considerable pains over the
revision of this poem. It was fine in its original form, but
every change found in the later version was a clear improvement.
No signs of the file are visible, and we should
certainly judge&mdash;unless we had evidence to the contrary&mdash;that
this imperishable 'ballad' had been thrown off at a
white heat. Only inferior to 'Agincourt' is the stirring
ode 'To the Virginian Voyage.' Professor Arber, a high
authority, is of opinion that it was composed some time
before 12th August 1606, on which day the Plymouth
Company despatched Captain Henry Challons' ship to
North Virginia. In this valedictory address Drayton
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Your course securely steer,</div>
  <div class="i0">West-and-by-South forth keep!</div>
  <div class="i1">Rocks,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Lee-shores, nor Shoals,</div>
  <div class="i1">When Æolus scowls,</div>
  <div class="i0">You need not fear:</div>
  <div class="i0">So absolute the deep.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Captain Challons sailed to Madeira, St. Lucia, Porto Rico,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
and thence towards North Virginia. His little ship of
fifty-five tons, with a crew of twenty-nine Englishmen (and
two native Virginians), had the ill-luck on 10th November
to fall in with the Spanish fleet of eight ships returning
from Havanna. It was captured by the Spaniards and the
crew were taken prisoners to Spain.</p>

<p>In a lighter vein, the ode beginning 'Maidens, why spare
ye,' was worthy to have been set to music by Robert Jones.
The seventh ode was written from the Peak in winter&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Amongst the mountains bleak,</div>
  <div class="i0">Exposed to sleet and rain'&mdash;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>where Charles Cotton afterwards resided. Drayton's statement
in the ninth ode&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'My resolution such</div>
  <div class="i0">How well and not how much</div>
  <div class="i0">To write'&mdash;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>will draw a smile from any reader who has ever seriously
attempted to grapple with his multitudinous works. But
in these odes, and in the other 'lyric poesies' added in the
1619 edition, he was careful to curb his tendency to diffuseness.
He employed a variety of metres, and his experiments
were not always happy. Ode 5, 'An Amouret Anacreontic,'
cannot be unreservedly commended, and Ode 9, 'A
Skeltoniad,' could be spared. One of the most attractive
poems is the address 'To his Rival,' a capital piece of
good-natured raillery. In his early work Drayton frequently
taxes the reader's patience by his disregard for grammatical
proprieties, and some of these maturer Odes are so ineptly
harsh that one has to grope for the writer's meaning (while
one bans the punctuation of old printers and modern
editors alike). Hence it is particularly pleasant to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
such a poem as 'To his Rival,' which never swerves awry,
but runs on blithely without an encountering obstacle.
The 'Hymn to his Lady's Birthplace' is a polished compliment,
and very charming is the canzonet 'To his Coy Love.'
I end with expressing a hope that the extracts here given
from Michael Drayton may induce the reader to make
further acquaintance<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> with the writings of one of the most
lovable of our elder poets.</p>

<p class="p4b">The conceit of this Idillion is very delicate. Wherein it is imagined
how <span class="smcap">Venus</span> did send for the Boar who in hunting slew <span class="smcap">Adonis</span>, a
dainty youth whom she loved: and how the Boar answering for
himself that he slew him against his will, as being enamoured on
him, and thinking only to kiss his naked thigh; she forgave him.
The Poet's drift is to shew the power of Love, not only in men, but
also in brute beasts: although in the last two verses, by the burning
of the Boar's amorous teeth, he intimateth that extravagant and
unorderly passions are to be restrained by reason.</p></blockquote>

</span>Entlemen; the last Terme [<em>i.e.</em>, <em>November</em> 1594]
there came forth a little toy of mine, intituled,
<cite>The affectionate Shepheard</cite>: In the which, his
Country <cite>Content</cite> found such friendly fauor, that it
hath incouraged me to publish my second fruites.
<cite>The affectionate Shepheard</cite> being the first: howsoeuer undeseruedly
(I protest) I haue beene thought (of some) to haue
beene the authour of two Books heretofore. I neede not to
name them, because they are two-well knowne already: nor
will I deny them, because they are dislik't; but because
they are not mine. This protestation (I hope) will satisfie
th'indifferent: as for them that are maliciously enuious, as
I cannot, so I care not to please. Some there were, that
did interpret <cite>The affectionate Shepheard</cite>, otherwise then (in
truth) I meant, touching the subiect thereof, to wit, the loue
of a Shepheard to a boy; a fault, the which I will not
excuse, because I neuer made. Onely this, I will vnshaddow
my conceit: being nothing else, but an imitation of <cite>Virgill</cite>,
in the second Eglogue of <cite>Alexis</cite>. In one or two places (in
this Booke) I vse the name of <cite>Eliza</cite> pastorally: wherein,
lest any one should misconster my meaning (as I hope none
will) I haue here briefly discouered my harmeles conceipt as
concerning that name: whereof once (in a simple Shepheards
deuice) I wrot this Epigramme.</p>

</span>Entlemen, being incouraged through your gentle
acceptance of my <em>Cynthia</em>, I haue once more aduentured
on your Curtesies: hoping to finde you
(as I haue done heretofore) friendly. Being
determined to write of somthing, and yet not
resolued of any thing, I considered with my selfe, if one
should write of Loue (they will say) why, euery one writes of
Loue: if of Vertue, why, who regards Vertue? To be short,
I could thinke of nothing, but either it was common, or not at
all in request. At length I bethought my selfe of a Subiect,
both new (as hauing neuer beene written vpon before) and
pleasing (as I thought) because Mans Nature (commonly)
loues to heare that praised, with whose pressence, hee is most
pleased.</p>

<p><em>Erasmus</em> (the glory of <em>Netherland</em>, and the refiner of the
Latin Tongue) wrote a whole Booke, in <cite>the prayse of Folly</cite>.
Then if so excellent a Scholler, writ in praise of Vanity, why
may not I write in praise of that which is profitable? There
are no two Countreys, where Gold is esteemed, lesse than in
<em>India</em>, and more then in <em>England</em>: the reason is, because the
<em>Indians</em> are barbarous, and our Nation ciuill.</p>

<p>I have giuen <em>Pecunia</em> the title of a Woman, Both for the
termination of the Word, and because (as Women are) shee
is lov'd of men. The brauest Voyages in the World, haue
beene made for Gold: for it, men haue venterd (by Sea) to
the furthest parts of the Earth: In the Pursute whereof,
<em>Englands Nestor</em> and <em>Neptune</em> (<em>Haukins</em> and <em>Drake</em>) lost their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>

writ this:</p>

</div>

<p>Of the latter this:</p>

  <div class="i0">England <em>his hart; his Corps the Waters haue;</em></div>

</div>

<p>The <em>Prætorians</em> (after the death of <em>Pertinax</em>) in the election
of a new Emperour, more esteemed the money of <em>Iulianus</em>,
then either the vertue of <em>Seuerus</em>, or the Valour of <em>Pessennius</em>.
Then of what great estimation and account, this Lady
<em>Pecunia</em>, both hath beene in the Worlde, and is at this present,
I leaue to your Iudgement. But what speake I so much of
her praise in my Epistle, that haue commended her so at
large in my Booke? To the reading wherof, (Gentlemen) I
referre you.</p>

<img src="images/i321_dropi.jpg" width="90" alt="I" /></span>N perusing your Loving Folly, and your Declining
from it; I do behold Reason conquering Passion.
The infirmity of loving argueth you are a man;
the firmness thereof, discovereth a good wit and
the best nature: and the falling from it, true virtue. Beauty
was always of force to mislead the wisest; and men of
greatest perfection have had no power to resist Love. The
best are accompanied with vices, to exercise their virtues;
whose glory shineth brightest in resisting motives of pleasure,
and in subduing affections. And though I cannot altogether
excuse your Loving Folly; yet I do the less blame you, in
that you loved such a one as was more to be commended for
her virtue, than beauty: albeit even for that too, she was so
well accomplished with the gifts of Nature as in mine conceit
(which, for good cause, I must submit as inferior to yours)
there was nothing wanting, either in the one or the other,
that might add more to her worth, except it were a more
due and better regard of your love; which she requited not
according to your deserts, nor answerable to herself in her
other parts of perfection. Yet herein it appeareth you have
made good use of Reason; that being heretofore lost in
youthful vanity, have now, by timely discretion, found yourself!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>Let me entreat you to suffer these your Passionate Sonnets
to be published! which may, peradventure, make others,
possessed with the like Humour of Loving, to follow your
example, in leaving; and move other <span class="smcap">Alcilias</span> (if there be
any) to embrace deserving love, while they may!</p>

<p>Hereby, also, she shall know, and, it may be, inwardly
repent the loss of your love, and see how much her perfections
are blemished by ingratitude; which will make your
happiness greater by adding to your reputation, than your
contentment could have been in enjoying her love. At the
least wise, the wiser sort, however in censuring them, they
may dislike of your errors; yet they cannot but commend
and allow of your reformation: and all others that shall with
indifferency read them, may reap thereby some benefit, or
contentment.</p>

<p>Thus much I have written as a testimony of the good will

  <div class="i0">And likes him best that's most intemperate.</div>

  <div class="i0">For when as he, <span class="smcap">Alcilia</span> first affected,</div>
  <div class="i0">(Like one in show, that love little respected)</div>
  <div class="i0">He masqued, disguised, and entertained his thought</div>

  <div class="i0">And still forbare to utter his desire,</div>
  <div class="i0">Till his delay receive her worthy hire.</div>
  <div class="i0">And well we know, what maids themselves would have,</div>
  <div class="i0">Men must sue for, and by petition crave.</div>
  <div class="i0">But he regarding more his Wealth, than Will;</div>
  <div class="i0">Hath little care his Fancy to fulfil.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet when he saw <span class="smcap">Alcilia</span> loved another;</div>
  <div class="i0">The secret fire, which in his breast did smother,</div>
  <div class="i0">Began to smoke, and soon had proved a flame:</div>
  <div class="i0">If Temperance had not allayed the same.</div>
  <div class="i0">Which, afterward, so quenched he did not find</div>
  <div class="i0">But that some sparks remainèd still behind.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus, when time served, he did refuse to crave it;</div>
  <div class="i0">And yet envied another man should have it!</div>
  <div class="i1">As though, fair maids should wait, at young men's pleasure,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whilst they, 'twixt sport and earnest, love at leisure.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nay, at the first! when it is kindly proffered!</div>
  <div class="i0">Maids must accept; least twice, it be not offered!</div>
  <div class="i0">Else though their beauty seem their good t'importune,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Yet may they lose the better of their fortune.</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus, as this Fondling coldly went about it;</div>
  <div class="i0">So in the end, he clearly went without it.</div>
  <div class="i0">For while he, doubtful, seemed to make a stay,</div>
  <div class="i0">A Mongrel stole the maiden's heart away;</div>
  <div class="i0">For which, though he lamented much in shew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet was he, inward, glad it fell out so.</div>
  <div class="i1">Now, <span class="smcap">Reason</span>! you may plainly judge by this,</div>
  <div class="i0">Not I, but he, the false dissembler is:</div>
  <div class="i0">Who, while fond hope his lukewarm love did feed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Made sign of more than he sustained indeed:</div>
  <div class="i0">And filled his rhymes with fables and with lies,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which, without Passion, he did oft devise;</div>
  <div class="i0">So to delude the ignorance of such</div>
  <div class="i0">That pitied him, thinking he loved too much.</div>
  <div class="i0">And with conceit, rather to shew his Wit,</div>
  <div class="i0">Than manifest his faithful Love by it.</div>
  <div class="i1">Much more than this, could I lay to his charge;</div>
  <div class="i0">But time would fail to open all at large.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let this suffice to prove his bad intent,</div>
  <div class="i0">And prove that <span class="smcap">Love</span> is clear and innocent."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">Thus, at the length, though late, he made an end,</div>
  <div class="i0">And both of us did earnestly, attend</div>
  <div class="i0">The final judgement, <span class="smcap">Reason</span> should award:</div>

  <div class="i0">For judgement, you must longer time abide!</div>

  <div class="i0">And so she, smiling, did adjourn the Court.</div>

<h3 style="page-break-before: avoid;"><em>The Argument.</em></h3>


<p><span class="figleft90">
<img src="images/i365_dropd.jpg" width="90" alt="D" /></span>A<span class="smcap">iphantus</span>, a younger brother, very honourably
descended, brought up but not born in Venice;
naturally subject to Courting, but not to Love;
reputed a man rather full of compliment, than of
true courtesy; more desirous to be thought honest, than
so to be wordish beyond discretion; promising more to all,
than friendship could challenge; mutable in all his actions,
but his affections aiming indeed to gain opinion rather than
goodwill; challenging love from greatness, not from merit;
studious to abuse his own wit, by the common sale of his
infirmities; lastly, under the colour of his natural affection
(which indeed was very pleasant and delightful) coveted to
disgrace every other to his own discontent: a scourge to
Beauty, a traitor to Women, and an infidel to Love.</p>

<p>This He, this creature, at length, falls in love with two at
one instant; yea, two of his nearest allies: and so indifferently
[<em>equally</em>] yet outrageously, as what was commendable in the
one, was admirable in the other. By which means, as not
despised, not regarded! if not deceived, not pitied! They
esteemed him as he was in deed, not words. He protested,
they jested! He swore he loved in sadness; they in sooth
believed, but seemed to give no credence to him: thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
him so humorous as no resolution could be long good; and
holding this his attestation to them of affection in that
kind, [no] more than his contesting against it before time.</p>

<p>Thus overcome of that he seemed to conquer, he became
a slave to his own fortunes. Laden with much misery, utter
mischief seized upon him. He fell in love with another,
a wedded Lady. Then with a fourth, named <span class="smcap">Vitullia</span>.
And so far was he imparadised in her beauty (She not recomforting
him) that he fell from Love to Passion, so to
Distraction, then to Admiration [<em>wonderment</em>] and Contemplation,
lastly to Madness. Thus did he <em>act</em> the Tragical
scenes, who only penned the Comical: became, if not as
brutish as <span class="smcap">Actæon</span>, as furious as <span class="smcap">Orlando</span>. Of whose
Humours and Passions, I had rather you should read them,
than I act them!</p>

<p>In the end, by one, or rather by all, he was recovered.
A Voice did mad him; and a Song did recure him! Four
in one sent him out of this world; and one with four
redeemed him to the world. To whose unusual strains in
Music, and emphatical emphasis in Love; I will leave you
to turn over a new leaf!</p>

<p>This only I will end with:</p>

<p><span class="figleft90">
<img src="images/i405_dropo.jpg" width="90" alt="O" /></span>D<span class="smcap">es</span> I have called these, the first of my few Poems;
which how happy soever they prove, yet Criticism
itself cannot say, That the name is wrongfully
usurped. For (not to begin with Definitions,
against the Rule of Oratory; nor <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab ovo</i>, against
the Prescript of Poetry in a poetical argument: but somewhat
only to season thy palate with a slight description)
an Ode is known to have been properly a Song
moduled to the ancient harp: and neither too short-breathed,
as hastening to the end; nor composed of [the]
longest verses, as unfit for the sudden turns and lofty tricks
with which <span class="smcap">Apollo</span> used to menage it.</p>

<p>They are, as the Learned say, divers:</p>

<p>Some transcendently lofty; and far more high than the
Epic, commonly called the Heroic, Poem&mdash;witness those of the
inimitable <span class="smcap">Pindarus</span> consecrated to the glory and renown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
of such as returned in triumph from [the Games at]
Olympus, Elis, Isthmus, or the like.</p>

<p>Others, among the Greeks, are amorous, soft, and made
for chambers; as others for theatres: as were <span class="smcap">Anacreon's</span>,
the very delicacies of the Grecian <span class="smcap">Erato</span>; which Muse
seemed to have been the Minion of that Teian old man,
which composed them.</p>

<p>Of a mixed kind were <span class="smcap">Horace's</span>. And [we] may truly
therefore call these mixed; whatsoever else are mine: little
partaking of the high dialect of the first</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Though we be <em>all</em> to seek</div>
  <div class="i0">Of <span class="smcap">Pindar</span>, that great Greek,</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>nor altogether of <span class="smcap">Anacreon</span>; the Arguments being amorous,
moral, or what else the Muse pleaseth.</p>

<p>To write much in this kind neither know I how it will
relish: nor, in so doing, can I but injuriously presuppose
ignorance or sloth in thee; or draw censure upon myself
for sinning against the decorum of a Preface, by reading a
Lecture, where it is enough to sum the points. New they
are, and the work of Playing Hours: but what other commendation
is theirs, and whether inherent in the subject,
must be thine to judge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But to act the Go-Between of my Poems and thy applause,
is neither my modesty nor confidence: that, oftener than
once, have acknowledged thee, kind; and do not doubt
hereafter to do somewhat in which I shall not fear thee,
just. And would, at this time, also gladly let thee understand
what I think, above the rest, of the last Ode of the
number; or, if thou wilt, Ballad in my book. For both
the great Master of Italian rymes <span class="smcap">Petrarch</span>, and our
<span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>, and others of the Upper House of the Muses,
have thought their Canzons honoured in the title of a <em>Ballad</em>:
which for that I labour to meet truly therein with the old
English garb, I hope as ably to justify as the learned <span class="smcap">Colin
Clout</span> his <cite>Roundelay</cite>.</p>

<p>Thus requesting thee, in thy better judgment, to correct
such faults as have escaped in the printing; I bid thee
farewell.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
